'''
Variables are containers for storing data values
Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type and can even change type after they have been set.
Variables can be assigned a value using the assignment operator '='.
'''

x = 5  #this is an integer variable
y = "Hello, World!"  #this is a string variable
z = 3.14  #this is a float variable

print(x)
print(y)
print(z)


#Casting
#Casting is the process of converting a variable from one type to another.
x = str(x)  #convert x to string
#Also used  to specify the type of a variable when it is created.
a = int(5)  #convert a to integer

#Get the Type
#Helps you get the data type of a variable.
print(type(x))  

#String Variables
#String variables can be declared either by using single or double quotes.
c = "Hello"
b = 'World'

#Case Sensitivity
#Variable names are case-sensitive.
D = 5
d = 10
print(D)
print(d)
